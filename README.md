# Hello, world!

## What to Do

 - Create a file `hello.py`
 - Write a line to print the message `Hello, world!` on the standard output
 - Save and close `hello.py`
 - Check if the test is ok (only 1 test) with command `./check [-v] hello.py`
 - `-v` option gives the difference between what is expected and what your script prints
  
> [!TIP]
> In Python, the function `print("a text")` prints `a text` on the standard output.
> For further information, [read the doc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print)!
